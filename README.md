#Bamazon!
  This is an app simulating an e-commerce store using mysql database. 
  The database includes: 
  ..*item_id (unique id for each product)


..*product_name (Name of product)


..*department_name


..*price (cost to customer)


..*stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

The app will prompt the user the ID of the item they would like th purchase as well as the quntity of the product they are wanting to puchase. 

The app will then check if the store currently has suffencent stock for the order to be placed base off the data in the mysql table.

..*If the product has enough units in stock the app will return "Approved"
..*If the product does not have enough units in stock the app will return "Declined"
